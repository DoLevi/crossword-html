# crossword-html

Crossword generation using
* [csv-parse](https://github.com/adaltas/node-csv/) to parse source data as csv,
* [cwg](https://github.com/gaoryrt/crossword-generator) to generate the crossword and
* my own code to create a very simplistic html

## Usage
```shell
git clone https://github.com/DoLevi/crossword-html
cd crossword-html
npm install
node index.js
```

## Configuration
To change filepaths etc. navigate to `crossword-html/index.js` and change the constants on the first few lines of the file.
